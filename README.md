# Dual-Quaternion-Library-C++

This library was build for Dual Quaternion Calculation Applications. <br><br>

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ::Create | array<double, 4> | Create Quaternion Rotation, Angle in Degree |
| ::Conjugate | array<double, 4> | Quaternion Conjugate |
| ::Normalize | double | Normalize Quaternion , Unit Quaternion = 1 |
| ::Add | array<double, 4> | Add Two Quaternions |
| ::Subtract | array<double, 4> | Subtract Two Quaternions |
| ::Multiply | array<double, 4> | Multiply Two Quaternions |
| ::MultiplyScalar | array<double, 4> | Multiply Quaternion with scalar value |

# Note : 
This library used std::array<> <br>
Any improvment are appreciated
